        We take pride in knowing that the products we send out the door are of the
        highest quality and will satisfy the most discriminating tastes. We know
        the difference between average quality Almonds and the high-yield, high-quality
        Almonds that we produce. Utilizing our plant-wide computer system, we track our
        Almonds so as to deliver the right product for each customer's demands. You
        can trust that you will receive what you asked for and then some.

        The backbone of our HACCP certification are our Standard Sanitary Operating
        Procedures (SSOP) and Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP). These guidelines allow
        us to understand and control our Famoso Nut Company production process to create
        valuable and safe products for our customers. To develop these plans and procedures
        we worked closely with top-quality industry experts. We consulted with the best
        to become the safe and secure plant that we are today. The process for achieving
        this certification was rigorous, and we work hard to stay in compliance so as to
        meet the needs of an ever-changing environment.
