        We produce a high quality consistent product that meets our customers need. We
        are able to do this because of our dedication, years of experience, our honed internal processes
        and our sophisticated almond processing database. We provide a high quality product
        by combining advanced electronic processing equipment with highly focused and well trained
        personnel. Every almond that leaves our facility has gone through a series of specialized pieces
        of equipment including optical scanners and is reviewed on conveyors by personnel before being
        packed and shipped.

        and that translates into more money in your pocket. All of our growers know that they
        have a standing invitation to come see their product run whenever they want or just to

        of getting a competitive return. We value the trust you put in us when you decide to
        send your product to us and we won't let you down.
