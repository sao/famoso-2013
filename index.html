            We take pride in knowing that the products we send out the door are of the
            highest quality and will satisfy the most discriminating tastes. We know
            the difference between average quality Almonds and the high-yield, high-quality
            Almonds that we produce. Utilizing our plant-wide computer system, we track our
            Almonds so as to deliver the right product for each customer's demands. You
            can trust that you will receive what you asked for and then some.

            The backbone of our HACCP certification are our Standard Sanitary Operating

            us to understand and control our Famoso Nut Company production process to create
            valuable and safe products for our customers. To develop these plans and procedures
            we worked closely with top-quality industry experts. We consulted with the best
            to become the safe and secure plant that we are today. The process for achieving
            this certification was rigorous, and we work hard to stay in compliance so as to
            meet the needs of an ever-changing environment.
