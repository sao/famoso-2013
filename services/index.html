    <h3>Growers</h3>
    <p>
      At Famoso Nut Company we understand how important our Growers are
      to the success of our company. Our commitment is to consistently
      return good prices as scheduled on our growers' almonds. At the
      processing stage this is done by always having efficiency in mind
      and continually improving our operations. At the sales stage we
      are always keeping abreast of where the market is headed.

    <h3>Facilities</h3>
    <p>
      We have two processing facilities, both of which contain some
      of the most advanced machinery in the nut processing industry.
      We are capable of efficiently processing almonds as inshell or
      shelled. This flexibility coupled with our knowledge of the
      marketplace enables us to maximize returns to our growers.
    </p>

    <h3>Staff</h3>
    <p>
      To accomplish our goals we start by having a professional
      staff with many years of experience in the almond industry.
      We understand every facet of this rapidly evolving environment.

    <h3>Reports</h3>
    <p>
      We value strong relationships and believe that transparency
      is very important which is why we provide our growers with
      detailed reports throughout the process. Our reports have been
      designed to be valuable tools for our growers. Our growers have
      the ability to access their reports securely through our website.
