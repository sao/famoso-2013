    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>
      For over two decades, Famoso Nut Company has processed and marketed
      California almonds to customers worldwide.
    </p>
    <p>
      We began as a huller in 1989 to process our own almonds. After gaining
      years of experience and making many improvements and refinements, we
      began accepting almonds from other growers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeing the increasing global demand for inshell almonds. In 2005 we
      expanded our operations with an additional facility calibrated specifically
      for inshell almonds in 2005.
    </p>
    <p>
      We value long-term relationships and work hard to provide the most consistent highest quality product possible.
